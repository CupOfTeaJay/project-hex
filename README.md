# Such is Life

 - **Such is Life** is intented to be a 4x strategy game very similar to the *Sid Meier's Civilization*
   series.
 - The goal is to keep the game's source code completely open-source (currently under AGPL), whilst
   the assets remain proprietary.
 - This project was born out of the desire for a game like Civ 6, but better. The idea is that
   if such a thing ever comes to be, and if people like it very much, it may be a game that will live for a very long time
   under an open-source community.
 - I want to learn Rust and the ECS pattern, so Bevy it is.
